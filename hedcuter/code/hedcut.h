/*
Wikipedia:

Hedcut is a term referring to a style of drawing, associated with The Wall Street Journal half-column portrait illustrations. 
They use the stipple method of many small dots and the hatching method of small lines to create an image, and are designed to 
emulate the look of woodcuts from old-style newspapers, and engravings on certificates and currency. 
The phonetic spelling of "hed" may be based on newspapers' use of the term hed for "headline."
